Since we're solving a binary classification problem (i.e., predicting a 0 or 1 target), we want to design classifiers. So far in the course we've covered the following simple classifiers: **k-nearest neighbors**, **decision trees**, and **logistic regression**.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Recap: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression models are linear models similar to linear regression models. Hopefully you somewhat remember them from lecture. Let's review them, starting with the linear regression equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +, \\dots, + \\beta_n x_n$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\hat{y}$ is our prediction, $\\beta$ is our vector of coefficients (the things we learn), and $x$ is our feature vector. The linear regression equation defines a line in $n$ dimensional space. The problem with linear regression is that it doesn't really perform well on classification tasks. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/linear-classification.png?raw=1\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The green line represents our trained linear regression model. Our feature is the size of a tumor, and our target is whether it is malignant or not (0 or 1). As we can see, even though our model is trained to the data to minimize error, for a lot of the values of tumor size it is going to give us a weird result (e.g., for some really small tumors, the prediction would be a negative value!).\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, we use the *logistic function* (also called the *sigmoid* function) to 'squish' our linear model to be bounded by 0 and 1. The logistic (sigmoid) function is $\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$, and thus our logistic regression equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\large\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +, \\dots, + \\beta_n x_n)}}$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, the values for $\\hat{y}$ can never be below 0, and can never exceed 1 even for the most extreme feature values $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TURN:**\n",
    "* Assuming you've trained a nice logistic regression model to the below data (see Figure), what might the model fit look like (i.e., what will the line look like)? **Answer: The line will be a sigmoid function, with the x-axis being the feature and the y-axis being the probability of the target being 1.**\n",
    "* For new data samples with features $x$, how would you convert the output of the logistic regression, $\\hat{y}$, into a classification (0 or 1)? **Answer: If $\\hat{y} > 0.5$, then we classify the sample as 1, otherwise we classify it as 0.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/logistic-classification.jpg?raw=1\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, cool! So a quick review of logistic regression. Let's use scikit-learn to fit a logistic regression model to our training set and then predict on our test set (we won't do cross validation this time). Remember, when we used decision trees and tree ensembles, our cross validation accuracy was somewhere from 75-80%.\n",

    "\n",
    "A *neural network* (NN) is a type of machine learning model that, like linear or logistic regression, takes a feature vector, X, as input and predicts a target, y. The way it does this is a little bit different, however. A typical NN architecture consists of: an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of a set of nodes (neurons) connected by edges (outputs). Let's look at the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/nn.jpeg?raw=1\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input layer**: This is a passive layer that simply takes in your feature data and outputs it to the hidden layers. You can think of each input layer neuron as being associated with a feature in your feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden layer**: This is where the magic happens. The original features, as received by the input layer, go through a series of transformations within the hidden layer. You can think of each node (neuron) within the hidden layer as a highly transformed feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output layer**: This is where we get our final result, the 0 or 1 prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zooming In\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what is happening at any given node (neuron) within the hidden layer. Take a look at the following image of a neuron within an NN:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/neuron.png?raw=1\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every neuron has some inputs ($x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$) with input weights ($w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$) and an output, $Y$. The neuron itself applies a transformation, $f$, known as the *activation function*, to the linear combination of its inputs and input weights. The value $b$ is a constant weight called the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of activation functions, but the popular ones are the *sigmoid*, *tanh*, and *ReLU* activation functions. Yes, you heard correctly: the sigmoid function is a popular activation function! (This should be reminding you of the logistic regression model we discussed above).\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TURN:**\n",
    "* If you were to develop a simple neural network architecture that was equivalent to a logistic regression model for the Titanic data, how would you do it? Get a pen and paper and draw it out. Make sure to specify: the input layer, the hidden layer(s), the output layer, the activation function(s), the weights, and the biases.\n",
    "* How many hidden layers does your NN have? What type of activation function, $f$, does it use? **Answer: 1 hidden layer, sigmoid activation function**\n",
    "* Say you wanted to add another layer to your NN architecture with 3x neurons, what would your new architecture look like?\n",
