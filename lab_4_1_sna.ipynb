    "### Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes, meaning it acts as a bridge. In detail, betweenness centrality of a **node v** is the percentage of all the shortest paths of any two nodes (apart from v), which pass through v.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in the facebook graph this measure is associated with the user's ability to influence others. A user with a high betweenness centrality acts as a bridge to many users that are not friends and thus has the ability to influence them by conveying information (e.g. by posting something or sharing a post) or even connect them via the user's circle (which would reduce the user's betweenness centrality after).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to degree centrality, the betweenness centrality of each node can be computed using the **.centrality.betweenness_centrality()** function of NetworkX, which returns a dictionary where the keys represent the nodes and the values indicate their degree centrality.\n",
