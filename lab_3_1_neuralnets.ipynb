    "\n",
    "Logistic regression models are linear models similar to linear regression models. Hopefully you somewhat remember them from lecture. Let's review them, starting with the linear regression equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +, \\dots, + \\beta_n x_n$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\hat{y}$ is our prediction, $\\beta$ is our vector of coefficients (the things we learn), and $x$ is our feature vector. The linear regression equation defines a line in $n$ dimensional space. The problem with linear regression is that it doesn't really perform well on classification tasks. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/linear-classification.png?raw=1\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The green line represents our trained linear regression model. Our feature is the size of a tumor, and our target is whether it is malignant or not (0 or 1). As we can see, even though our model is trained to the data to minimize error, for a lot of the values of tumor size it is going to give us a weird result (e.g., for some really small tumors, the prediction would be a negative value!).\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, we use the *logistic function* (also called the *sigmoid* function) to 'squish' our linear model to be bounded by 0 and 1. The logistic (sigmoid) function is $\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$, and thus our logistic regression equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\large\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +, \\dots, + \\beta_n x_n)}}$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, the values for $\\hat{y}$ can never be below 0, and can never exceed 1 even for the most extreme feature values $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TURN:**\n",
    "* Assuming you've trained a nice logistic regression model to the below data (see Figure), what might the model fit look like (i.e., what will the line look like)? ____________________________________\n",
    "* For new data samples with features $x$, how would you convert the output of the logistic regression, $\\hat{y}$, into a classification (0 or 1)? ______________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "A *neural network* (NN) is a type of machine learning model that, like linear or logistic regression, takes a feature vector, X, as input and predicts a target, y. The way it does this is a little bit different, however. A typical NN architecture consists of: an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of a set of nodes (neurons) connected by edges (outputs). Let's look at the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/nn.jpeg?raw=1\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input layer**: This is a passive layer that simply takes in your feature data and outputs it to the hidden layers. You can think of each input layer neuron as being associated with a feature in your feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden layer**: This is where the magic happens. The original features, as received by the input layer, go through a series of transformations within the hidden layer. You can think of each node (neuron) within the hidden layer as a highly transformed feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output layer**: This is where we get our final result, the 0 or 1 prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zooming In\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what is happening at any given node (neuron) within the hidden layer. Take a look at the following image of a neuron within an NN:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/lyeskhalil/mlbootcamp/blob/master/img/neuron.png?raw=1\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every neuron has some inputs ($x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$) with input weights ($w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$) and an output, $Y$. The neuron itself applies a transformation, $f$, known as the *activation function*, to the linear combination of its inputs and input weights. The value $b$ is a constant weight called the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of activation functions, but the popular ones are the *sigmoid*, *tanh*, and *ReLU* activation functions. Yes, you heard correctly: the sigmoid function is a popular activation function! (This should be reminding you of the logistic regression model we discussed above).\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TURN:**\n",
    "* If you were to develop a simple neural network architecture that was equivalent to a logistic regression model for the Titanic data, how would you do it? Get a pen and paper and draw it out. Make sure to specify: the input layer, the hidden layer(s), the output layer, the activation function(s), the weights, and the biases.\n",
    "* How many hidden layers does your NN have? What type of activation function, $f$, does it use? _________________\n",
